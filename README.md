# ESP32_Wroom_Programmer
This neat little board solves the issue always having a USB-UART Converter on your board when building a design with an ESP32. Some of you now may say "But this is just a simple USB-UART Converter I can get that on Aliexpress for a few â‚¬". But the thing that makes this sweet little board special, is that it has the auto-programming circuit from the ESP-Devboards. so by only exposing 5-6 Pins you can programm your custom PCB the same way you would do it on a Devkit (Plus it has USB-C but thats kinda the standard by now).

I hope you find it as usefull as me,
happy Building :)
